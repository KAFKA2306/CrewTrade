# Temporary Reports

Markdown reports rendered during local validation are written here when you do not specify a permanent output directory.

## Usage
- Open `securities_collateral_loan_report.md` and `..._insights.md` to verify formatting or copy key sections into documentation.
- Once the changes are promoted (for example, into `AITradingCrew/output/backtests/...`), remove the temporary files to keep the workspace clean.
