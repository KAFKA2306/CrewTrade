## Key Themes in Rerated Leadership
1.  **Technologist CEOs:** Oracle (Magouyrk/Sicilia), IBM (Krishna), and SAP (Klein) specifically elevated leaders deeply embedded in Product/Cloud strategy rather than pure sales/finance execution.
2.  **Long Tenure/Stability:** Most CFOs are long-time company veterans who understand the complex legacy financial models (support/license) while managing the transition to subscription/consumption models.
3.  **Founder Presence:** Oracle and Dell still have heavy founder involvement (Ellison, Dell) driving the aggression of the pivot.
